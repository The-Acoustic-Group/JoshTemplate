<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Trigger - an observation that relates to a potential problem.<br />
<br />
Think - a question that makes people think differently about their current solution.<br />
<br />
Third-party credibility - what similar people are doing to reduce the risk.<br />
<br />
Talk? - gauge interest. “Either way,” subconsciously says, “There’s no pressure here.”<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
“Josh - Looks like you’re training for your first marathon in Miami. How are you reducing the risk of plantar fasciitis &amp; hammertoe caused by a narrow toe box? Cramped shoes hinder the natural movement of your toes.<br />
<br />
Over 2000 runners use our wide-toe box shoe which allows toes to splay naturally, preventing injury.<br />
<br />
Worth a look?<br />
<br />
Either way, rock that run.<br />
James”<br />
