<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}, nice meeting you, albeit virtually.<br />
<br />
I know there are a lot of choices out there for [company product/service category], so thanks for considering us.<br />
<br />
So I don't do you a disservice by wasting your time, here are four reasons why we might not be a fit:<br />
<br />
EXAMPLES - REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN TERMS<br />
1. I don’t sign service agreements or NDAs, nor do I require confidential information. I have a simple plain English one-page agreement.<br />
2. I require payment upfront.<br />
3. Workshops are 20-30k.<br />
4. I don't have availability until the end of May.<br />
<br />
We can discuss the details, of course, but first, I wanted to find out if you’re okay with the $, terms, and dates.</body>
